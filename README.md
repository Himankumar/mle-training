# Median housing value prediction

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data. 

The following techniques have been used: 

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

## Steps performed
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
 - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
 - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.

## To excute the script
 - Load the conda evironment named env.yml using command > conda env create -f env.yml
 - Activate the conda environment > conda activate mle-dev
 - Run the python code > python nonstandardcode.py
 - Deactivate the environment when not needed > conda deactivate
 
 The above 4 steps will complete the execution for the python script.
